# Minimal Android App

This project contains a minimal Android App set to be built from command line,
this was developed following [this tutorial](https://www.hanshq.net/command-line-android.html).
The app itself contains basically just a Hello World String and nothing more.
However the project's Makefile may be useful as a start point for larger projects.
